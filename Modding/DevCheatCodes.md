To help with modding, here are some cheat codes you can use in the game to speed up testing.

Type in: /enablecmds in the chat window to enable the cheat commands. (If the chat window is not visible you can toggle it on in the settings.

After the cheat commands are enabled you can use these:


/Skiphoursawake  (This prevents the player from passing out)



/Addnpchearts NPCName 1000 (This manipulates the NPC heart level. Each heart is 100 points)
Example /Addnpchearts Zoey 1000


/Spawn ItemRowName Number (This spawns any item in the game. You must use the row name of the item in order for it to spawn, not necessarily what it is called in the inventory)
Example /Spawn ItemRowName Number 


/Setstamina (This sets the stamina of the player. Max stamina is 100)
Example /Setstamina 100


/SetGold (this sets the amount of gold)
Example /Setgold 1000 (Sets the 1000 gold)
